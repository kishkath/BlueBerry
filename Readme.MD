Blueberry plants require pollination by bees, because of their nature, wild blueberry flowers require cross-pollination. A desirable fruit set can rarely be met without the introduction of managed bees. The quantity of bees is important in order to counter the effects of genetic and climatic factors which can influence pollination.
 
Blueberry plants depend on insects for their pollination. The U.S. produces more than  700 million pounds of highbush blueberries per year, so blueberry pollination is important economically as well as ecologically. Because blueberry flowers are bell shaped, with their interior recessed in a tube of petals, effective release of pollen from the flowers depends on an insect behavior of rapidly vibrating wing muscles, called buzz pollination. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) do not perform buzz pollination, and thus are thought to be inefficient as blueberry pollinators. Despite this, all large blueberry farms of five or more acres rent honey bee hives, and the honey bees successfully aid in crop pollination, more on this: https://entomologytoday.org/2018/12/07/no-buzz-no-problem-study-shows-how-honey-bees-pollinate-blueberries/
